Link streams model many real- world situations like email exchanges between individuals, connections between devices, and others. Much work is currently devoted to the generalization of clas- sical graph and network concepts to link streams. In this paper, we generalize the existing notions of intra-community density and inter-community density. We focus on emails exchanges in the Debian mailing-list and show that threads of emails, like communities in graphs, are dense subsets loosely connected from a link stream perspective.},

@article{gaumont-2016-finding-remarkably-dense-sequences-of-contacts,
 abstract = {A link stream is a set of quadruplets (b, e, u, v) meaning that a link exists between u and v from time b to time e. Link streams model many real-world situations like contacts between individuals, connections between devices, and others. Much work is currently devoted to the generalization of classical graph and network concepts to link streams. We argue that the density is a valuable notion for understanding and characterizing links streams. We propose a method to capture specific groups of links that are structurally and temporally densely connected and show that they are meaningful for the description of link streams. To find such groups, we use classical graph community detection algorithms, and we assess obtained groups. We apply our method to several real-world contact traces (captured by sensors) and demonstrate the relevance of the obtained structures.},

@inproceedings{karger-1993-global-min-cuts-in-rnc-and-other-ramifications-of-a-simple,
 abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for finding global min-cuts in weighted, undirected graphs.  One of the strengths of the algorithm is its extreme simplicity.  This randomized algorithm can be implemented as a strongly polynomial sequential algorithm with runnint time O(mn2), even if space is restricted to O(n), or can be parallelized as an RNC algorithm which runs in time O(log2n) on a CRCW PRAM with mn2log n processors.  In addition to yielding the best known processor bounds on unweighted graphs, this algorithm provides the first proof that the min-cut problem for weighted undirected graphs is in RNC.  The algorithm does more than find a single min-cut; it finds all of them.  The glgorithm also yields numerous results on network reliability, enumeration of cuts, multi-way cuts, and approximate min-cuts.},

@article{latapy-2017-stream-graphs-and-link-streams-for-the-modeling,
 abstract = {Graph theory provides a language for studying the structure of relations, and it is often used to study interactions over time too. However, it poorly captures the both temporal and structural nature of interactions, that calls for a dedicated formalism. In this paper, we generalize graph concepts in order to cope with both aspects in a consistent way. We start with elementary concepts like density, clusters, or paths, and derive from them more advanced concepts like cliques, degrees, clustering coefficients, or connected components. We obtain a language to directly deal with interactions over time, similar to the language provided by graphs to deal with relations. This formalism is self-consistent: usual relations between different concepts are preserved. It is also consistent with graph theory: graph concepts are special cases of the ones we introduce. This makes it easy to generalize higher-level objects such as quotient graphs, line graphs, k-cores, and centralities. This paper also considers discrete versus continuous time assumptions, instantaneous links, and extensions to more complex cases.},

@article{shi-2018-meetingvis:-visual-narratives-to-assist-in-recalling,
 abstract = {In team-based workplaces, reviewing and reflecting on the content from a previously held meeting can lead to better planning and preparation. However, ineffective meeting summaries can impair this process, especially when participants have difficulty remembering what was said and what its context was. To assist with this process, we introduce MeetingVis, a visual narrative-based approach to meeting summarization. MeetingVis is composed of two primary components: (1) a data pipeline that processes the spoken audio from a group discussion, and (2) a visual-based interface that efficiently displays the summarized content. To design MeetingVis, we create a taxonomy of relevant meeting data points, identifying salient elements to promote recall and reflection. These are mapped to an augmented storyline visualization, which combines the display of participant activities, topic evolutions, and task assignments. For evaluation, we conduct a qualitative user study with five groups. Feedback from the study indicates that MeetingVis effectively triggers the recall of subtle details from prior meetings: all study participants were able to remember new details, points, and tasks compared to an unaided, memory-only baseline. This visual-based approaches can also potentially enhance the productivity of both individuals and the whole team.},

@article{tanahashi-2012-design-considerations-for-optimizing-storyline-visualizations,
 abstract = {Storyline visualization is a technique used to depict the temporal dynamics of social interactions. This visualization technique was first introduced as a hand-drawn illustration in XKCD's ``Movie Narrative Charts'' [21]. If properly constructed, the visualization can convey both global trends and local interactions in the data. However, previous methods for automating storyline visualizations are overly simple, failing to achieve some of the essential principles practiced by professional illustrators. This paper presents a set of design considerations for generating aesthetically pleasing and legible storyline visualizations. Our layout algorithm is based on evolutionary computation, allowing us to effectively incorporate multiple objective functions. We show that the resulting visualizations have significantly improved aesthetics and legibility compared to existing techniques.},

The framework includes three components: a new data management scheme for processing and storing the incoming data, a layout construction algorithm specifically designed for incrementally generating storylines from streaming data, and a layout refinement algorithm for improving the legibility of the visualization. By dividing the layout computation to two separate components, one for constructing and another for refining, our framework effectively provides the users with the ability to follow and reason dynamic data. The evaluation studies of our storyline visualization framework demonstrate its efficacy to present streaming data as well as its superior performance over existing methods in terms of both computational efficiency and visual clarity.},

@article{viard-2017-discovering-patterns-of-interest-in-ip-traffic-using,
 abstract = {Studying IP traffic is crucial for many applications. We focus here on the detection of (structurally and temporally) dense sequences of interactions, that may indicate botnets or coordinated network scans. More precisely, we model a MAWI capture of IP traffic as a link streams, i.e. a sequence of interactions (t1, t2, u, v) meaning that devices u and v exchanged packets from time t1 to time t2. This traffic is captured on a single router and so has a bipartite structure: links occur only between nodes in two disjoint sets. We design a method for finding interesting bipartite cliques in such link streams, i.e. two sets of nodes and a time interval such that all nodes in the first set are linked to all nodes in the second set throughout the time interval. We then explore the bipartite cliques present in the considered trace. Comparison with the MAWILab classification of anomalous IP addresses shows that the found cliques succeed in detecting anomalous network activity.},

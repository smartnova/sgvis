 abstract = {This tutorial provides a programmer's introduction to the Satisfiability Modulo Theories Solver Z3. It describes how to use Z3 through scripts, provided in the Python scripting language, and it describes several of the algorithms underlying the decision procedures within Z3. It aims to broadly cover almost all available features of Z3 and the essence of the underlying algorithms.},
